Powershell Wrapper for SSH
==========================

Once downloaded, move the script to ~/Documents/WindowsPowershell then
edit your profile.ps1 to source it:

	. ~/Documents/WindowsPowershell/ssh-agent.ps1

This will put three functions into your environment:

	Start-SshAgent
	Stop-SshAgent
	Get-SshAgent

They do exactly what it says on the tin, and set the environment variables 
SSH_AGENT_PID and SSH_AUTH_SOCK correctly. Once running, keys can be added
using ssh-add.exe as normal.
