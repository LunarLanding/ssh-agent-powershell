Powershell Wrapper for ssh-agent
================================

Once downloaded, move the script to ~/Documents/WindowsPowershell then
edit your profile.ps1 to source it:

	. ~/Documents/WindowsPowershell/ssh-agent.ps1

This will put three functions into your environment:

	Start-SshAgent
	Stop-SshAgent
	Get-SshAgent

They do exactly what it says on the tin, and set the environment variables 
SSH_AGENT_PID and SSH_AUTH_SOCK correctly. These variables are set at both
the process and user level, so any new processes started in the user session
after the agent has started will inherit the same ssh-agent configuration.

Once running, keys can be added using ssh-add.exe as normal.

The ssh-agent used is that from a standard Git install (using Git for Windows
from https://git-scm.com/ ), which by default is in %PROGRAMFILES%\usr\bin.
